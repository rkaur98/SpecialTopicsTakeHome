# AWS SNS and SQS

Amazon Simple Queue Service(SQS) and Simple Notification Service(SNS) can be used together to deliver powerful messaging service. SQS can also integrate with other AWS services like EC2, S3, DynamoDB, RDS, Lambda, etc to generate flexible and scalable apps. Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) is a flexible, fully managed pub/sub messaging and mobile notifications service. By using Amazon SNS and Amazon SQS together, messages can be delivered to applications that require immediate notification of an event, and also persisted in an Amazon SQS queue for other applications to process at a later time.

SQS and SNS work together in a pattern known as 'fanout'. In this pattern, SNS publish a message for task, which is further supplied to number of queues. These queues are parallel and independent of each other. Each queue can perform a different task at a same time, thus decreasing the processing time for all tasks to be completed.
