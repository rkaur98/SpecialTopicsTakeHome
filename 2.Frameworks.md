# Frameworks for microservices and serverless architecture

Here are two available alternative frameworks to the Serverless framework:

## 1. APEX

Apex manages Serverless applications intended for AWS Lambda. It provides a user-friendly command-line-interface (CLI) to create Serverless projects, add functions, and deploy on AWS. A variety of workflow related tooling is provided for testing functions, rolling back deploys, viewing metrics, tailing logs, hooking into the build system, etc.

Currently support languages:

<li>Node.js</li>
<li>Golang</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>Rust</li>
<li>Clojure</li>

### Key Benefits

<li>Support for languages that Lambda does not natively support via shim</li>
<li>Environment variable population via command-line, file, or inline config</li>
<li>Multiple environments via project.ENV.json and function.ENV.json files</li>
<li>Command-line function invocation with JSON streams</li>
<li>Command & function name autocompletion</li>
<li>Function metrics and cost analysis</li>
<li>Function rollback support</li>
<li>Concurrency for quick deploys</li>
<br/>

## 2. AWS - SAM

AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) can be used to define serverless applications in simple and clean syntax. It is an open source project used to define various parts of a lambda application e.g. Amazon API Gateway APIs, Lambda functions, and DynamoDB tables. It supports a local CLI to test, upload, and deploy the application. During deployment, SAM automatically translates the application’s specification into CloudFormation syntax, filling in default values for any unspecified properties and determining the appropriate mappings and invocation permissions to setup for any Lambda functions.

### Key Benefits

<li>It is made available under the Apache 2.0 license, enabling others in the ecosystem to adopt and incorporate it into build, deployment, monitoring and management tools with a commercial-friendly license.</li>
<li>Simplified process of packaging Serverless application using CLI</li>
<li>Function rollback support</li>
<li>Translates application’s specification into CloudFormation syntax</li>
